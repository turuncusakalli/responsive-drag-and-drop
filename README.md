# responsive-drag-and-drop

## Hi there! This project's comment lines are in English and Turkish


In this project, I made responsive drag and drop website. When you drag an item, you will see that item's some basic information on console. It has only these functions. Nothing more. Hope, will be helpful.

I used Muuri library for grid, drag and drop process. Here is the documentation link: https://github.com/haltu/muuri#table-of-contents
